		<h1>Module Overview</h1>
		</div>
			<h2>Week 1: Introduction</h2>
			<p>Learning Objectives: By the end of the week, students will be able to:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Access one of the free human design chart websites and generate their chart based on their precise birth date, time, and location.</li>
			<li>Discuss what human design is and what it can do for them using the collaboration tools provided.</li>
			<li>Recall the 3 main attributes of their chart and write a 200 word reflection on their perception of accuracy.</li>
			</ol>
	<h2>Week 2: Digging Deeper into Youur Bodygraph</h2>
		<p>Learning Objectives: By the end of the week, students will be able to:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Compare and contrast defined and open gates and detail their chart findings in 400 words.</li>
			<li>Describe the ways in which they are influenced by external energies in a discussion with their peers using the provided collaboration tools provided.</li>
			<li>Explain the ways in which they are influenced by their design in a discussion with their peers using the provided collaboration tools provided.</li>
			<li>Discuss in their own words what conditioning and deconditioning is with their peers. </li>
		</ol>
	<h2>Week 3: Integrating Ancient Teachings </h2>
		<p>Learning Objectives: By the end of this week, students will be able to:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Explain how the planets impact the interpretation of their defined gates with 80% accuracy on a quiz-style assessment.</li>
			<li>Correctly identify how Human Design uses the Chinese I'Ching in a discussion with peers.</li>
			<li>Correctly identify how that Kabbalah Tree of Life is and how it's integrated into Human Design in a discussion with peers. </li>
			<li>Discuss elements of their chart related to the topics this week using the collaboration tools provided.</li>
		</ol>
	<h2>Week 4: Getting more Detailed with Channels, Gates, and Lines</h2>
		<p>Learning Objectives: By the end of this week, students will be able to:</p>
		<ol>
				<li>Recall the difference between red and black gates and channels with 80% accuracy on a quiz-style assessment.</li>
				<li>Discuss elements of their chart related to the topics this weekusing the collaboration tools provided.</li>
		</ol>
	<h2>Week 5: Check Point</h2>
		<p>This week will be used to explore any of the areas discussed above in more detail and provide an opportunity for you to ask specific questions, connent with Human Design mentors, and begin a self-exploration research study. At the end of the course, you will be turning in an analysis of your findings and a well-defined plan of how to play to decondition and being living your authentic life - you should be starting your experiment this week and journaling your reflections, revelations, and ideas for your plan moving forward.</p>
	<h2>Week 6-8: Advanced Topics</h2>
		<p>Over the next 3 weeks, we will introduce some of the more advanced topics learners are usually intrigued to learn about. This includes:</p>
			<ul><li>Transformation Types - the Arrows at the top of your chart</li>
				<li>How your genetics or DNA integrates with Human Design</li>
				<li>Gene Keys - and discovering your life path</li>
				<li>Circuits</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Learning Objectives: By the end of week 8, students will be able to:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Correctly identify the Four Transformation Types using Jenna Zoe's calculator.</li>
				<li>Write a 500 word reflection on their Gene Key findings.</li>
				<li>Accurately recall their circuits and their meanings with 80% accuracy on a quiz-style assessment</li>
				<li>Discuss how genetics and conditioning play a role in Human Design using the collaboration tools provided.</li>
			</ol>
	<h2>Week 9: Relationships and Human Design</h2>
			<p>By now, you're probably itching to know how all of this comes together in creating better relationship with friends, foes, and lovers - that's exactly what this week will cover. </p>

	<h2>Week 10: Wrapping Up</h2>
		<p>Hopefully by now, you have learned a great deal about yourself, why you just inherently are the way you are, and some of the ways in which you make the most out it. But, as we learned in the previous week, Human Design is much more than what you find in your chart, but how your energy works with those around you. </p>

		<ol>
			<li>Submit a detailed plan to decondition and start living by their design using the SMART method.</li>
